##### A static map image view that generates a map snapshot and drawn line based on a provided ```MKPolyline``` object.

Intended for inline use with UITableView or UICollectionView where maps would be shown per cell or similar. 

##### version 0.1 (Current)
+ Generates a UIImage from an Apple Map based on an MKPolyline object.
+ Draws a line tracing the MKPolyline on top of the taken UIImage.
+ Caches the UIImage and loads it dynamically regardless of App state.
+ Configurable:
	- Images can be converted to greyscale.
	- All map options are configurable (POI, Buildings, mapType).
	- Set the color of the drawn line.
	- Set a placeholder image while the Map image is generated.
	- Border and corner rounding is toggleable.
+ Scaleable (untested)
